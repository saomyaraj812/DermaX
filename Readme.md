## Introduction

Welcome to our Skin Disease Diagnosis project! This project leverages the power of the Xception architecture to diagnose skin diseases using images as input. Early and accurate diagnosis can make a significant impact on patients' lives, and this project aims to provide a tool to assist healthcare professionals in their work.

## Features

- State-of-the-art Xception architecture for accurate diagnosis.
- User-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing skin images using tkinter library.
- Fast and efficient image processing for real-time results.
